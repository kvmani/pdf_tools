- All code must be formatted with `black` and checked with `flake8`.
- Every function requires unit tests using `pytest`.
- Continuous integration runs `pytest` and lint checks.
- Success criteria for a pull request:
  - No linter errors.
  - All tests pass.
  - Documentation is updated when behavior changes.
